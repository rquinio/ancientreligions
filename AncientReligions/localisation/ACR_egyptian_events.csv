hold_sed_festival_desc;Traditionally, after 30 years of rule and every 3 years after that, a Pharaoh holds a festival to celebrate his continuous success, renew his royal powers and rejuvenate his strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ancrel_4010;On the first day of the festival, you present offerings to the gods. Then, while seated and crowned on a raised platform, the priests carry the statues of the gods and present offerings, in a sign of giving thanks for past loyalty and to secure good relationships in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ancrel_4010;This is good to be the Pharaoh !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ancrel_4011;On the second day, attired with a short kilt with a bull's tail in its back, you prepare yourself to run the ritual race alongside the Apis Bull. The course is bounded by two points symbolizing the borders of the realm, to reinforce your dominion over the whole kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_ancrel_4011;I dedicate the race to the gods !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ancrel_4012;On the last day, you are carried in a procession to visit the chapels of the gods. At the chapel of Horus, you receive the crook and the flail. At the two chapels of Horus and Seth, you are handed a bow and arrow, to shoot an arrow in each one of the four directions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_ancrel_4012;Praise the gods !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
